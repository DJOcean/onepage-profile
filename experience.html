            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My responsibilities included keeping sales high and labor low, running shifts, handling cash registers and large amounts of money, and making sure that every customer was happy. Running shifts was what interested me the most. I loved the fact I could place any employee I wanted in any area that  I felt could get the job done best. It took a bit of strategy but I got really good at coaching and training new crew to suit the roster. McDonalds introduced a restaurant department management system in which I had the opportunity to become a department manager. Taking on the role as the 'People Department' manager, my responsibilities began to include creating the weekly schedule for over 65 employees, inventory, planning company outings, keeping track of calendars and dates, labor analysis, and developing a stronger customer focus. After a while of doing this I was offered a 1st assistant management position and was chosen to be the leader of training development in 5 surrounding stores. Being self-motivated, I was in charge of attending and creating my own conference calls, meeting and setting deadlines, and ensuring consistent training procedures are being held in each of the stores I was in charge of. This proved most fulfilling because not only did I get my own first hand experience at my restaurant, I could see what types of problems other restaurants have and solve those as well. </li>

            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned the functions of a full service restaurant. Applying what I knew before, adapting this environment was easy. I was in charge of schedules, training, paperwork, and inventory. Among other things I would plan goals, attend meetings, plan agendas, roll out new menus, and run shifts. </li>
